## Introduction

In the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning, ensuring the integrity and privacy of model predictions is critical. Deep Prove aims to bridge this gap by leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic techniques. This framework allows developers to prove that their models produce valid outputs without revealing the underlying data or the model itself.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast Proving**: Deep Prove optimizes the proving process, making it suitable for real-time applications.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Maintain the privacy of your data while still proving the validity of your model's predictions.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with various machine learning frameworks.
- **Easy to Use**: A simple API allows for quick integration into existing projects.

## Installation

To get started with Deep Prove, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnyaaap/deep-prove.git
cd deep-prove
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installing Deep Prove, you can start using it in your machine learning projects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to prove a model's inference:

```python
from deep_prove import Prover

# Load your model
model = load_model('your_model.h5')

# Create a prover instance
prover = Prover(model)

# Input data for inference
input_data = get_input_data()

# Prove inference
proof = prover.prove(input_data)

# Verify proof
is_valid = prover.verify(proof)
print(f"Is the proof valid? {is_valid}")
```

This example demonstrates the basic workflow of loading a model, creating a prover instance, and proving the inference of the model with input data.
